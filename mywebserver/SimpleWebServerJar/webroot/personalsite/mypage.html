        <p>Dr. Joshua M. Paiz is a teaching assistant professor of English for Academic Purposes <abbr title="English for Academic Purposes">EAP</abbr> at the <a href="https://www.gwu.edu">George Washington University</a>. He holds a Ph.D. in applied linguistics and a master's degree in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (<abbr title="Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages")>TESOL</abbr>). He also holds professional certificate in English language program management from TESOL International Association and Data Analytics from Google. He is currently preparing to puruse a second master's in Applied Computer Sciences this fall at <abbr title="the George Washington University">GWU</abbr>.</p>

        <p>As a member of the EAP faculty, Dr. Paiz's primary work sees him working with undergraduate international students as they begin their academic careers at a U.S. institution. Utilizing a sociocognitive approach to teaching, Dr. Paiz works to leverage students' experiences and abilities to help facilitate learning for the whole class. During his time with the EAP program, he has also been focused significant energy towards helping the program achieve its strategic plan of impacting English language teaching and learning throughout the <abbr title="DC, Maryland, Virginia">DMV</abbr> through partnerships with various units on campus, other colleges/universities, and different non-profit/non-government organizations that aid immigrant and English language learning students.</p>

        He is currently working on his second academic monograph, <a href="https://journals.equinoxpub.com/books/issue/view/3235"><em>Collaboriatve AI: Artificial Intelligence, Expertise, and Pedagogy in English Language Teaching</a></em>, which is expected out in late 2024 through Equniox UK.</a> This book will explore how the advent of powerful generative AI models intersects with English language teaching and may, if properly managed, positively impact student success and instructor workloads. His first monograph, <a href="https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/queering-english/"><em>Queering the English Language Classroom: A Practical Guide for Teachers</em></a> sought to provide ELT practitioners with research-based, practical advice on increasing equity and inclusion for gender and sexual minorities in ELT settings. He has also co-edited collections on gender and sexual diversity in foreign/second language teaching (<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-76779-2"><em>Intersectional Perspectives on LGBTQ+ Issues in Modern Language Teaching and Learning</em></a>) and on global issues in second language writing (<em>Second language Writing in the Global Context: Represented, Underrepresented, and Unrepresented Voices</em>).</p>
